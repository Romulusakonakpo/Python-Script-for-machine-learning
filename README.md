Predictive analysis in python using scikit-learn on data collected from several financial companies around the world. The aim of the analysis was to predict a binary variable that indicates whether the company presents a high risk of financial distress or a low risk.
## Predictive analysis of financial distress risk in global financial institutions


In an ever-changing economic world, the ability to anticipate and manage financial risks is of crucial importance in ensuring the stability and viability of financial institutions. Early detection of signs of financial distress in these institutions is essential to take preventive action and mitigate potential negative impacts on the global economy.

In this context, this study focuses on the application of predictive analytics techniques to a dataset collected from several financial institutions worldwide. The main objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately and reliably predicting the risk of financial distress in these institutions. More specifically, we aim to determine whether a given institution presents a high or low risk of financial distress, using explanatory variables such as financial indicators, solvency ratios, past performance, and other relevant characteristics.

To achieve this goal, we used the power of Python and the scikit-learn library to develop and evaluate several machine learning models. Using supervised learning techniques, we trained these models on a historical dataset featuring examples of financial institutions with different levels of financial distress. Next, we evaluated the performance of these models using measures such as precision, recall, classification ratio, and other relevant indicators.

The results of this predictive analysis will provide decision-makers and financial sector players with valuable information for assessing and managing the risks associated with financial institutions. By identifying early warning signs of financial distress, these results could help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system and ensure its long-term stability.

In the following sections, we describe in detail the methodology used, the characteristics of the data, the predictive analysis techniques implemented, as well as the results and conclusions of this study.
